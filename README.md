# Markov-model
A simple project of making a Markov model Classifier, during my studies in NLP. This was done as a project that was a part of a udemy course by Lazy programmer Inc.
The poem files used were the ones provided by Lazy programmer Inc.

Download the txt files as well and then copy their path to paste in the program

Make sure that the file path is set correctly in the apporpriate list

The model has an accuracy of around 66.42% with test_size set to .2

This was just a learning experience, and the model, as is evident didnt fare too well in terms of accuracy compared to even the most rudimentary 
modern NLP algorithms

Better datasets did increase the accuracy value, so that could be a good means of improving overall accuracy
